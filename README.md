Jenkins Pipeline for Python flask-based application using SonarQube, Argo CD, Helm and Kubernetes.
Note: for terraform details please check terraform_my_aks README 
Note: for application please check poc_test README

Jenkins: for continuous integration Argo CD: for continuous deployment

STEPS: Prerequisites:

Python flask application code hosted on a Git repository Docker Jenkins server Kubernetes cluster Helm package manager Argo CD

STEPS:

Install the necessary Jenkins plugins: 1.1 Git plugin or configure with webhooks 
1.2 Pipeline plugin
1.3 Kubernetes Continuous Deploy plugin

Jenkins pipeline: 2.1 Configure Jenkins with git Repository by webhook for continuous integration.
OR 2.2 Use plugin

Define the pipeline stages: Stage 1: Checkout the source code from Git.
Stage 2: Build the Python flask app using docker. 
Stage 3: Run SonarQube analysis to check the code quality.
Stage 4: Deploy the application to a test environment using Helm.
Stage 5: Run user acceptance tests on the deployed application.
Stage 6: Promote the application to a production environment using Argo CD.

Configure Jenkins pipeline stages: Stage 1: Use the Git plugin to check out the source code from the Git repository.
Stage 2: build an application using the docker
Stage 3: Use the SonarQube plugin to analyze the code quality of the application. 
Stage 4: Use the Kubernetes Continuous Deploy plugin to deploy the application to a test environment using Helm. 
Stage 4: can also Use a testing framework like Selenium to run user acceptance tests on the deployed application.
Stage 5: Use Argo CD to promote the application to a production environment.

Set up Argo CD: Install Argo CD on the Kubernetes cluster using the operator or Helm. 
my-aks-charts Helm chart for the application that includes the Kubernetes manifests and Helm values.
Set up a Git repository for Argo CD to track the changes in the my-aks- charts and Kubernetes manifests.
Argo CD is tracking changes between my-aks-charts and Kubernetes and updates states automatically.

Configure Jenkins pipeline to integrate with Argo CD:
6.1 Add the Argo CD API token to Jenkins credentials.
6.2 Update the Jenkins pipeline to include the Argo CD deployment stage.
